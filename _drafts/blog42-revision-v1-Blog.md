Newhart is known for his [deadpan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deadpan) delivery and a slight [stammer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stuttering) that he incorporated early on into the persona around which he built a successful career. On his TV shows, although he got his share of funny lines, he worked often in the [Jack Benny](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jack_Benny) tradition of being the “straight man” while the sometimes rather bizarre cast members surrounding him got the laughs. But Newhart has said, “I was not influenced by Jack Benny”, and cites [George Gobel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Gobel) and [Bob and Ray](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bob_and_Ray) as his initial writing and performance inspirations.

**George Robert Newhart** (born September 5, 1929) is an American comedian and actor. He is known for his [deadpan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deadpan) and stammering delivery style. Beginning as a stand-up comedian, he transitioned his career to acting in television. He has received numerous accolades, including three [Grammy Awards](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grammy_Awards), an [Emmy Award](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Primetime_Emmy_Award), and a [Golden Globe Award](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golden_Globe_Award). He was honored with the [Mark Twain Prize for American Humor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mark_Twain_Prize_for_American_Humor) in 2002.

But Newhart has said, “I was not influenced by Jack Benny”, and cites [George Gobel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Gobel) and [Bob and Ray](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bob_and_Ray) as his initial writing and performance inspirations.

## Comedic style

Newhart is known for his [deadpan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deadpan) delivery and a slight [stammer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stuttering) that he incorporated early on into the persona around which he built a successful career. On his TV shows, although he got his share of funny lines, he worked often in the [Jack Benny](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jack_Benny) tradition of being the “straight man” while the sometimes rather bizarre cast members surrounding him got the laughs. But Newhart has said, “I was not influenced by Jack Benny”, and cites [George Gobel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Gobel) and [Bob and Ray](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bob_and_Ray) as his initial writing and performance inspirations.

### *Bob* and *George &amp; Leo*

<figure class="wp-block-image">[![](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/1c/Bob_Newhart%2C_1991.jpg/170px-Bob_Newhart%2C_1991.jpg)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Bob_Newhart,_1991.jpg)</figure>In 1992, Newhart returned to television with a series about a [cartoonist](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cartoonist) called *[Bob](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bob_(TV_series))*. An ensemble cast included [Lisa Kudrow](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lisa_Kudrow), but the show did not develop a strong audience and was canceled shortly after the start of its second season, despite good critical reviews. On *The Tonight Show* following the cancellation, Newhart joked he had now done shows called *The Bob Newhart Show*, *Newhart* and *Bob* so his next show was going to be called *The*.

In 1997, Newhart returned again with *[George &amp; Leo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_%26_Leo)* on CBS with [Judd Hirsch](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Judd_Hirsch) and [Jason Bateman](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jason_Bateman) (Newhart’s first name being George); the show was canceled during its first season.

 During an episode of *[Jimmy Kimmel Live!](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jimmy_Kimmel_Live!)*, Newhart made a comedic cameo with members of the ABC show *[Lost](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lost_(2004_TV_series))* lampooning an alternate ending to the series finale. In 2011, he appeared in a small but pivotal role as a doctor in Lifetime’s anthology film on breast cancer *Five*. In 2013, he made a guest appearance on *The Big Bang Theory* as the aged Professor Proton (Arthur Jeffries), a former science TV show host turned children’s party entertainer, for which he won the Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Guest Actor in a Comedy Series.
